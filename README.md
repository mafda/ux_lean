## LEAN UX Principles

LEAN UX principles help us establish a new work culture for ourselves.

1. Multidisciplinary teams: It is essential to work with people who can work well in all areas of development.
2. Small, dedicated, and united groups: It needs to be a small team to ensure control, in which everyone knows each other.
3. Progress: It needs to be worked on in terms of value, not functionalities or products.
4. Problem-focused teams: It can not focus on features, but rather on problems to be solved.
5. Remove the waste: Whatever is not useful, do not build; do not spend money on anything.
6. Small deliveries: It needs to be little to have more feedbacks, as soon as possible, to fail fast, but to succeed quickly.
7. Continuous delivery: The user should be seeing what is being built on knowing that it will be useful.
8. Goob (Get Out Of the Building): You need to know the world through the user's eyes.
9. Shared knowledge: The team needs to understand the problem they are attacking and have the same view of the product.
10. Leveled times: Do not have any stars on the team. If the group is level, it advances along.
11. Try to outsource your work: It is good to have an environment that values innovation and promote a collaborative environment.
12. Making over-analyzing: Try to create more than explain. Try to get feedback as soon as possible.
13. Learn before climbing: Instead of creating a giant product, first, learn with the user.
14. Permission to fail: You should create an environment conducive to testing, not an environment conducive to negligence failures.
15. Quit the business of deliverables: Documents are essential for understanding decisions, but the team should focus on functionalities.
